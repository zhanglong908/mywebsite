    You need to know your goal and become the best front-end developer. To achieve it, you must make a plan.
    <br />
    If you look at twitter or jobs, usually you'll see that calling yourself a front-end developer needs to know
    10 to 20 things. Such a long list is ridiculous.
    <br />
    You don't need to know everything. In fact, you can find a job as well. Sometimes, even experienced
    developers don't know and understand everything.
    <br />
    Therefore, web front-end development is based on three basic skills:
    <br />
    These are the three skills you can use to build almost everything. If you have a good grasp of them, it is
    enough to find a job in front-end development. Of course, you also need to know one or two JavaScript
    frameworks, which is even better.
    <br />
    Seriously study these three basic skills.
    <br />
    Don't start by learning Vue JS, react, angular, etc. Finally, you choose a framework and stick to it.
    <br />
    How to choose the framework to learn? My personal suggestion is to choose the framework that you are
    interested in and the demand of the job market is large. If there are many needs for junior angular
    developers, please learn angular. If other frameworks are in high demand, please choose the one with high
    demand. If you are not sure, choose a framework that you are interested in and popular. Of course, you can
    also choose react. After all, you need to learn a framework.
    <br />
    What about the other technologies listed in the job requirements? You should read something about them, but
    you can almost ignore them.
    <br />
    You can complete the basic knowledge in git in a day or two, but it's also very important. Stylized
    components, if you know JavaScript and CSS, you can quickly master them. Module bundle, you are likely to
    use the starter package for a long time in your career.
